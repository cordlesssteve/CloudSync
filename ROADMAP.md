# CloudSync Product Roadmap
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Created:** 2025-09-27
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-27
**Planning Horizon:** Next 3-6 months
**Current Quarter:** Q4 2025

## Strategic Vision
**Product Vision:** Comprehensive, reliable cloud synchronization system with real-time monitoring, conflict resolution, and automated backup capabilities for development environments and critical data.

**Current Focus:** Transform from basic unidirectional sync to intelligent bidirectional synchronization with conflict resolution and real-time monitoring.

## Roadmap Timeline

### Q4 2025 (Current Quarter)
**Theme:** "Intelligent Sync Foundation"
**Success Metrics:**
- Bidirectional sync operational with <1% conflict rate
- Real-time monitoring with <5 second detection
- 90%+ sync reliability across all test scenarios

#### High Priority Features (Must Have)
- **Bidirectional Sync with rclone bisync** - Enable two-way synchronization
  - **Value:** Eliminates manual conflict resolution, enables multi-device workflows
  - **Effort:** L (Large - complex rclone integration)
  - **Dependencies:** rclone bisync feature stability
  - **Status:** In Development (25% complete)

- **Conflict Detection & Resolution** - Automatic conflict detection with resolution strategies
  - **Value:** Prevents data loss, reduces manual intervention
  - **Effort:** M (Medium - logic implementation)
  - **Dependencies:** Bidirectional sync foundation
  - **Status:** Not Started

- **Real-time File Monitoring** - inotify-based automatic sync triggers
  - **Value:** Immediate sync response, improved workflow efficiency
  - **Effort:** M (Medium - system integration)
  - **Dependencies:** System inotify support
  - **Status:** In Planning

#### Medium Priority Features (Should Have)
- **Comprehensive Testing Framework** - Automated testing for sync scenarios
  - **Value:** Reliability assurance, regression prevention
  - **Effort:** M (Medium - test infrastructure)
  - **Status:** Not Started

- **Performance Monitoring** - Sync performance metrics and optimization
  - **Value:** System optimization, bottleneck identification
  - **Effort:** S (Small - metrics collection)
  - **Status:** Not Started

- **Smart Deduplication** - Automated duplicate file detection and removal
  - **Value:** Storage optimization, reduced sync overhead
  - **Effort:** S (Small - rclone dedupe automation)
  - **Status:** Under Evaluation

- **Checksum Verification System** - Automated integrity checking for all synced files
  - **Value:** Data integrity assurance, corruption detection
  - **Effort:** S (Small - rclone check automation)
  - **Status:** Under Evaluation

#### Low Priority Features (Could Have)
- **Web Dashboard** - Browser-based monitoring interface
- **Multi-cloud Support** - Support for additional cloud providers beyond OneDrive
- **Delta Sync Optimization** - Enhanced rsync-style chunking for large files

### Q1 2026 (Next Quarter)
**Planned Theme:** "Advanced Features & Reliability"

#### Tentative Features
- **Selective Sync Profiles** - Configurable sync profiles for different scenarios
- **Incremental Merge Capabilities** - Advanced merge strategies for log files and configurations
- **Advanced Backup Strategies** - Enhanced Restic integration with automated retention
- **Encrypted Sync** - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- **Bandwidth Management** - Network usage optimization and throttling
- **API Integration** - REST API for external system integration

## Feature Evaluation Criteria
**Scoring Framework:** Features prioritized by user impact, reliability needs, and implementation complexity

1. **User Impact** (1-5): Daily workflow improvement and pain point resolution
2. **Reliability Value** (1-5): System stability and data safety impact
3. **Technical Effort** (1-5): Implementation complexity and resource requirements
4. **Strategic Alignment** (1-5): Alignment with vision of intelligent, reliable sync

## Dependencies & Constraints
### External Dependencies
- **rclone bisync stability:** Bidirectional sync depends on rclone bisync reliability
- **Cloud provider APIs:** OneDrive API stability and rate limits
- **System inotify:** File system monitoring capabilities

### Resource Constraints
- **Development Time:** Single developer part-time availability
- **Testing Environment:** Limited to personal development setup
- **Storage Costs:** OneDrive storage limitations for backup testing
