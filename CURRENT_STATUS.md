## 🎯 NEW FEATURE: GIT BUNDLE SYNC SYSTEM

**CloudSync now includes git bundle sync** to dramatically reduce OneDrive API calls by syncing repositories as single bundle files instead of thousands of individual files. This addresses OneDrive rate limiting issues.

## CURRENT SESSION: NAMING REFACTOR (2025-10-16)

**Renaming `csync-managed` → `csync-managed`** for clarity:
- **cloudsync** = CloudSync repository (the full tool)
- **csync-managed** = Managed storage directory (upload folder)

## Today's Completed Work ✅ (2025-10-16 Session)

### 📋 **SCRIPT REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS & STANDARDIZATION**

**Script Inventory & Analysis:**
- ✅ Analyzed 27 CloudSync core system scripts
- ✅ Verified CloudSync repo IS backed up via git-bundle-sync (daily to OneDrive)
- ✅ Confirmed GitHub provides standard repo backup
- ✅ Identified script organization: Tier 1 (utilities) vs Tier 2 (core CloudSync)

**Script Standardization Completed:**
- ✅ **weekly_restic_backup.sh** - Standardized across repo and active locations
  - Now uses centralized `~/.cloudsync-secrets.conf` (more secure)
  - Added exclusions: `$HOME/projects`, `$HOME/temp`, `$HOME/media`
  - Repo version now matches active version exactly

- ✅ **dev-env-sync.sh** - Consolidated to enhanced version
  - Promoted cloud/ version (435 lines) with ADDITIONAL_PATHS concept
  - Now syncs 7GB additional valuable data (~Sync, Andy_Files, system-state, etc.)
  - Better organization separating CRITICAL vs ADDITIONAL paths
  - Reflects current strategy (mcp-servers now GitHub-backed)
  - All 3 locations (repo/core, system, cloud) now identical

**Architectural Review:**
- ✅ Verified cron jobs correctly call from repo (single source of truth)
- ✅ Confirmed 21 core CloudSync scripts ARE protected via git-bundle-sync
- ✅ No redundancy risk - backup paths are optimal
- ✅ Decision to keep repo as development location is correct

**Documentation Created:**
- ✅ Comprehensive redundancy analysis (CloudSync system scripts focused)
- ✅ Standardization verification report
- ✅ Architectural findings document

## Previous Session Work ✅ (2025-10-15 Session)

### 🔒 **COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY AUDIT & CREDENTIAL CONSOLIDATION**

**System Assessment:**
- ✅ Verified CloudSync production status - 59 repos synced successfully
- ✅ Analyzed backup schedule (cron + anacron coverage)
- ✅ Confirmed git bundle sync operational (last run: Oct 15 12:17 PM)
- ✅ Traced sync execution (anacron catch-up due to system downtime at 1 AM)

**Credential Security Overhaul:**
- ✅ Created `~/.cloudsync-secrets.conf` (permissions 600) for centralized secrets
- ✅ Removed hardcoded OpenAI API key from `update_vector_embeddings.sh`
- ✅ Updated script to use local Nomic embeddings (zero-cost, no API calls)
- ✅ Migrated Restic password from 2 scripts to secrets file
- ✅ Migrated Neo4j password from script to secrets file
- ✅ Migrated Anthropic API key from `.bashrc` to secrets file
- ✅ Migrated GitHub Personal Access Token from `.bashrc` to secrets file
- ✅ Updated 2 test scripts to use environment variables instead of hardcoded keys

**Secrets File Contents:**
- Restic backup password
- Neo4j database password
- Anthropic API key (for SDK/custom scripts, NOT Claude Code)
- GitHub personal access token

**Anacron Coverage Enhanced:**
- ✅ Added restore verification job (7-day catch-up, disaster recovery validation)
- ✅ Added security audit job (7-day catch-up)

**Embedding Model Consistency:**
- ✅ Verified conversation-search uses `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` (768 dims)
- ✅ Verified metaMCP-RAG uses `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` (768 dims)
- ✅ Removed dangerous fallback to `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dims)
- ✅ Replaced silent fallback with proper error handling (fail fast with instructions)
- ✅ Updated 4 files in metaMCP-RAG: `ingest.py`, `retriever.py`, `rag_service.py`, `setup.py`

**Files Modified:**
1. `~/scripts/system/update_vector_embeddings.sh` - OpenAI key removed, uses Nomic
2. `~/scripts/system/weekly_restic_backup.sh` - Sources secrets file
3. `~/scripts/system/startup_health_check.sh` - Sources secrets file
4. `~/scripts/system/set-neo4j-password.sh` - Sources secrets file
5. `~/.bashrc` - Sources secrets file instead of hardcoding
6. `~/scripts/claude/test_fresh_api_key.js` - Uses env var
7. `~/scripts/claude/debug_api_access.js` - Uses env var
8. `~/.anacrontab` - Added 2 new catch-up jobs
9. `metaMCP-RAG/rag-tool-retriever/ingest.py` - Proper error handling
10. `metaMCP-RAG/rag-tool-retriever/retriever.py` - Proper error handling
11. `metaMCP-RAG/rag-tool-retriever/rag_service.py` - Updated model reference
12. `metaMCP-RAG/rag-tool-retriever/setup.py` - Tests Nomic model

**Security Status:**
- ✅ Zero hardcoded credentials in scripts
- ✅ All secrets in one secure file (600 permissions)
- ✅ Environment variables loaded via `.bashrc` sourcing
- ✅ Claude Code authentication unchanged (uses OAuth in `~/.claude/.credentials.json`)
- ✅ Embedding models consistent across both MCP servers (no dimension mismatch risk)
