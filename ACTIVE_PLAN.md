**Status:** ACTIVE
**Created:** 2025-09-27
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-27 13:50
**Phase:** Core Features Complete → Real-time Monitoring Phase
**Supersedes:** N/A (Initial plan)
**Archived Version:** [docs/progress/2025-09/ACTIVE_PLAN_2025-09-27_1350.md](./docs/progress/2025-09/ACTIVE_PLAN_2025-09-27_1350.md)

## Current Focus: Core Features Complete → Real-time Monitoring Implementation

## Recently Completed ✅
- ✅ **Smart Deduplication** - Hash-based and name-based duplicate detection
- ✅ **Checksum Verification** - MD5/SHA1 integrity checking with JSON reporting
- ✅ **Bidirectional Sync** - Two-way synchronization with rclone bisync
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution** - Interactive and automated conflict handling
- ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation** - Architecture, setup, and troubleshooting guides

## Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 Weeks)

### 1. Real-time File Monitoring (High Priority)
**Status:** 25% Complete (Design phase)
**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] Implement inotify-based file monitoring
- [ ] Create automated sync triggers
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Integrate with health check system

**Files to Create:**
- `scripts/monitoring/real-time-monitor.sh` - File system monitoring
- `scripts/monitoring/sync-trigger.sh` - Automated sync triggers
- `config/monitoring.conf` - Real-time monitoring configuration

### 2. Web Dashboard (Medium Priority)
**Status:** 0% Complete
**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] Design web interface for monitoring
- [ ] Implement status API endpoints
- [ ] Create real-time status display
- [ ] Add configuration management interface

### 3. Performance Optimization (Medium Priority)
**Status:** 0% Complete
**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] Implement parallel operations
- [ ] Add bandwidth management
- [ ] Optimize large file handling
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks

## Success Criteria
- [x] ✅ Bidirectional sync works reliably
- [x] ✅ Conflict detection and resolution functional
- [ ] Real-time monitoring operational
- [x] ✅ Core feature test coverage complete

## Weekly Milestones
### Week 1 (2025-09-27 to 2025-10-04) - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] ✅ Complete Universal Documentation Standard implementation
- [x] ✅ GitHub repository setup and privacy configuration
- [x] ✅ Implement complete bidirectional sync system
- [x] ✅ Create comprehensive conflict detection and resolution system
- [x] ✅ Implement smart deduplication and checksum verification
- [x] ✅ Complete technical documentation suite

### Week 2 (2025-10-04 to 2025-10-11) - UPDATED PRIORITIES
- [ ] Real-time monitoring implementation (inotify-based)
- [ ] Web dashboard development
- [ ] Performance optimization and parallel operations
- [ ] Multi-cloud provider support planning

## Risk Mitigation
### High-Risk Items - RESOLVED ✅
1. **✅ rclone bisync complexity:** Bidirectional sync may be unreliable
   - *Resolution:* Successfully implemented with comprehensive conflict resolution
   - *Status:* Fully operational with dry-run testing validation

2. **File system monitoring overhead:** Real-time monitoring may impact performance
   - *Mitigation:* Configurable monitoring intervals and efficient inotify implementation
   - *Fallback:* Current health monitoring system as backup

### New Risk Items
1. **Real-time monitoring resource usage:** inotify may consume system resources
   - *Mitigation:* Selective monitoring with configurable patterns
   - *Fallback:* Polling-based monitoring as alternative

## Strategic Context
This plan focuses on transitioning from core feature completion to advanced monitoring and performance optimization. All primary sync capabilities are now operational, enabling focus on real-time features and user experience enhancements.

## Contact Points
### Immediate Next Actions (Next Week)
1. **Priority 1:** Design and implement inotify-based real-time monitoring
2. **Priority 2:** Create web dashboard prototype for system monitoring
3. **Priority 3:** Optimize performance with parallel operations and bandwidth management
