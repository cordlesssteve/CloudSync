**Research Needed:**
- [ ] rclone bandwidth management capabilities
- [ ] Common bandwidth usage patterns

#### Smart Deduplication
**Status:** Under Evaluation
**Evaluation Started:** 2025-09-27

**Description:** Intelligent file deduplication using rclone dedupe with hash-based detection to eliminate duplicate files
**User Story:** As a user with limited storage, I want automatic deduplication so that I don't waste space on identical files

**Evaluation Scores:**
- **User Impact:** 4/5 - Significantly reduces storage usage and sync time
- **Reliability Value:** 4/5 - Prevents sync conflicts from duplicate files
- **Technical Effort:** 2/5 - rclone dedupe is built-in, just need automation
- **Strategic Alignment:** 4/5 - Aligns with intelligent sync optimization
- **Total Score:** 14/20

**Research Needed:**
- [x] rclone dedupe capabilities confirmed (supports hash-based detection)
- [ ] Best practices for automated deduplication scheduling
