# CloudSync Documentation Instructions

## üö® MANDATORY READING ORDER üö®
Before starting ANY development work, Claude MUST read these files in order:

1. **[CURRENT_STATUS.md](./CURRENT_STATUS.md)** - Current reality and what's actually done
2. **[ACTIVE_PLAN.md](./ACTIVE_PLAN.md)** - What we're currently executing
3. Only then reference other documentation for context

## Project Context
- **Platform:** utility-system
- **Current Version:** v0.1.0 (0% complete)
- **Active Branch:** main
- **Focus:** Initial project setup and planning

## Documentation Rules

### Plan Status Indicators - ALWAYS CHECK THESE
- **ACTIVE**: Currently executing - use this plan
- **ARCHIVED**: Completed/historical - reference only
- **SUPERSEDED**: Replaced by newer plan - ignore unless needed for context
- **BLOCKED**: Waiting for external input - cannot proceed

### When Plans Change
1. Move old plan to `./docs/plans/archived/`
2. Update status header to "SUPERSEDED" or "ARCHIVED"
3. Create new versioned plan with clear "ACTIVE" status
4. Update CURRENT_STATUS.md with latest reality
5. Log the change in weekly progress

### Weekly Context Handoff Protocol
Every Friday session should end with:
1. Update CURRENT_STATUS.md with actual progress
2. Archive any completed plans
3. Update component status matrix
4. Log key decisions made this week

### Red Flags üö®
**STOP and ask for clarification if you see:**
- Multiple plans marked as "ACTIVE"
- Conflicting information between CURRENT_STATUS.md and ACTIVE_PLAN.md
- Plans that haven't been updated in >1 week
- Missing status headers on planning documents

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Development Workflow
- Follow established coding standards for the project type
- Maintain comprehensive testing coverage
- Document architectural decisions
- Use semantic versioning for releases

### Quality Standards
- Code must be reviewed before merging
- All features require documentation
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained
- Security considerations must be documented

## Emergency Contacts
- **Technical Blockers:** Document in CURRENT_STATUS.md
- **Plan Confusion:** Update this file and create clear ACTIVE_PLAN.md

**Remember:** This documentation system is designed to prevent plan confusion and ensure every Claude Code session starts with accurate, current project information.
