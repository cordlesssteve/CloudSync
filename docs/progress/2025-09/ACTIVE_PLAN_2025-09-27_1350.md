# CloudSync Active Development Plan
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Created:** 2025-09-27
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-27
**Phase:** Foundation Setup → Feature Development
**Supersedes:** N/A (Initial plan)

## Current Focus: Foundation Complete → Bidirectional Sync Implementation

## Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 Weeks)

### 1. Bidirectional Sync Implementation (High Priority)
**Status:** 25% Complete
**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] Implement rclone bisync integration
- [ ] Add conflict detection mechanisms
- [ ] Create conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Test bidirectional sync workflows

**Files to Work On:**
- `scripts/core/bidirectional-sync.sh` - New bidirectional sync script
- `scripts/core/conflict-resolver.sh` - Conflict resolution logic
- `config/bisync.conf` - Bisync-specific configuration

### 2. Real-time Monitoring (Medium Priority)
**Status:** 25% Complete
**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] Implement inotify-based file monitoring
- [ ] Create automated sync triggers
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Integrate with health check system

**Files to Work On:**
- `scripts/monitoring/real-time-monitor.sh` - File system monitoring
- `scripts/monitoring/sync-trigger.sh` - Automated sync triggers

### 3. Testing Framework (Medium Priority)
**Status:** 0% Complete
**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Add integration tests for sync scenarios
- [ ] Implement automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Bidirectional sync works reliably
- [ ] Conflict detection and resolution functional
- [ ] Real-time monitoring operational
- [ ] Test coverage >80%

## Weekly Milestones
### Week 1 (2025-09-27 to 2025-10-04)
- [x] Complete Universal Documentation Standard implementation
- [x] GitHub repository setup and privacy configuration
- [ ] Implement basic bidirectional sync
- [ ] Create conflict detection system

### Week 2 (2025-10-04 to 2025-10-11)
- [ ] Real-time monitoring implementation
- [ ] Testing framework setup
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Risk Mitigation
### High-Risk Items
1. **rclone bisync complexity:** Bidirectional sync may be unreliable
   - *Mitigation:* Extensive testing and fallback to unidirectional
   - *Fallback:* Manual conflict resolution workflow

2. **File system monitoring overhead:** Real-time monitoring may impact performance
   - *Mitigation:* Configurable monitoring intervals
   - *Fallback:* Scheduled sync as backup

## Strategic Context
This plan focuses on moving from the foundation phase to feature implementation. The core infrastructure is complete, allowing focus on advanced sync capabilities and monitoring.

## Contact Points
### Immediate Next Actions (This Week)
1. **Priority 1:** Implement rclone bisync with basic conflict detection
2. **Priority 2:** Create real-time file monitoring system
3. **Priority 3:** Set up comprehensive testing framework
