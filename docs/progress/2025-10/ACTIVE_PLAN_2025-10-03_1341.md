# CloudSync Active Development Plan
**Status:** ACTIVE - ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION
**Created:** 2025-09-27
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-03 13:20
**Phase:** Foundation Complete → Intelligent Orchestrator Development
**Supersedes:** Real-time Monitoring Phase (architecture pivot)
**Archived Version:** [docs/progress/2025-09/ACTIVE_PLAN_2025-09-27_1350.md](./docs/progress/2025-09/ACTIVE_PLAN_2025-09-27_1350.md)

## 🎯 MAJOR ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION (2025-10-03)
**CloudSync is pivoting from a sync tool to an intelligent orchestrator** that coordinates Git, Git-Annex, and rclone with unified versioning and smart tool selection.

## Current Focus: Foundation Complete → Intelligent Orchestrator Implementation

## Recently Completed ✅ (Foundation Layer)
- ✅ **Smart Deduplication** - Hash-based and name-based duplicate detection
- ✅ **Checksum Verification** - MD5/SHA1 integrity checking with JSON reporting
- ✅ **Bidirectional Sync** - Two-way synchronization with rclone bisync
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution** - Interactive and automated conflict handling
- ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation** - Architecture, setup, and troubleshooting guides
- ✅ **Git-Annex Integration** - Full OneDrive integration with rclone transport
- ✅ **Multi-Device Coordination** - Device metadata and distributed coordination

## NEW IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 1-2 Weeks) - ORCHESTRATOR LAYER

### 1. Intelligent Orchestrator Core (High Priority)
**Status:** 25% Complete (Design phase)
**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] Build decision engine for Git/Git-annex/rclone routing
- [ ] Create unified interface (cloudsync add/sync/rollback commands)
- [ ] Implement context detection (git repo, file size, file type)
- [ ] Design managed storage structure (~/csync-managed/)

**Files to Create:**
- `scripts/cloudsync-orchestrator.sh` - Main orchestrator interface
- `scripts/decision-engine.sh` - Smart tool selection logic
- `scripts/managed-storage.sh` - Git-based storage management

### 2. Unified Versioning System (High Priority)
**Status:** 25% Complete (Design phase)
**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] Implement Git-based versioning for all file types
- [ ] Create managed storage Git repository structure
- [ ] Build rollback and history commands
- [ ] Integrate with existing CloudSync features

**Files to Create:**
- `scripts/unified-versioning.sh` - Git-based versioning for all files
- `scripts/rollback-manager.sh` - Version history and rollback
- `config/managed-storage.conf` - Managed storage configuration

### 3. Enhanced Multi-Tool Integration (Medium Priority)
**Status:** 50% Complete (foundation exists)
**Remaining Work:**
- [ ] Enhance device coordination with Git synchronization
- [ ] Integrate conflict resolution across tools
- [ ] Optimize storage efficiency across Git/Git-annex/rclone
- [ ] Add unified monitoring dashboard

## Success Criteria (Updated for Orchestrator Phase)
- [x] ✅ Foundation layer complete (sync, conflicts, git-annex)
- [x] ✅ Multi-tool integration working (Git + Git-annex + rclone)
- [ ] **Intelligent orchestrator operational** (NEW PRIMARY GOAL)
- [ ] **Unified versioning across all file types** (NEW)
- [ ] **Single interface for all operations** (cloudsync commands)
- [ ] **Smart tool selection based on context** (NEW)

## Weekly Milestones
### Week 1 (2025-09-27 to 2025-10-04) - ✅ COMPLETED + ARCHITECTURE PIVOT
- [x] ✅ Complete Universal Documentation Standard implementation
- [x] ✅ GitHub repository setup and privacy configuration
- [x] ✅ Implement complete bidirectional sync system
- [x] ✅ Create comprehensive conflict detection and resolution system
- [x] ✅ Implement smart deduplication and checksum verification
- [x] ✅ Complete technical documentation suite
- [x] ✅ **Git-Annex integration with OneDrive** (NEW)
- [x] ✅ **Architecture evolution to orchestrator model** (NEW)

### Week 2 (2025-10-04 to 2025-10-11) - ORCHESTRATOR DEVELOPMENT
- [ ] **Build core orchestrator with decision engine** (NEW PRIMARY)
- [ ] **Implement unified interface (cloudsync commands)** (NEW PRIMARY)
- [ ] **Create managed storage with Git foundation** (NEW PRIMARY)
- [ ] **Design and test unified versioning system** (NEW PRIMARY)
- [ ] Update all documentation for new architecture

## Risk Mitigation
### High-Risk Items - RESOLVED ✅
1. **✅ rclone bisync complexity:** Bidirectional sync may be unreliable
   - *Resolution:* Successfully implemented with comprehensive conflict resolution
   - *Status:* Fully operational with dry-run testing validation

2. **File system monitoring overhead:** Real-time monitoring may impact performance
   - *Mitigation:* Configurable monitoring intervals and efficient inotify implementation
   - *Fallback:* Current health monitoring system as backup

### New Risk Items
1. **Real-time monitoring resource usage:** inotify may consume system resources
   - *Mitigation:* Selective monitoring with configurable patterns
   - *Fallback:* Polling-based monitoring as alternative

## Strategic Context
This plan focuses on transitioning from core feature completion to advanced monitoring and performance optimization. All primary sync capabilities are now operational, enabling focus on real-time features and user experience enhancements.

## Contact Points
### Immediate Next Actions (Next Week)
1. **Priority 1:** Design and implement inotify-based real-time monitoring
2. **Priority 2:** Create web dashboard prototype for system monitoring
3. **Priority 3:** Optimize performance with parallel operations and bandwidth management
