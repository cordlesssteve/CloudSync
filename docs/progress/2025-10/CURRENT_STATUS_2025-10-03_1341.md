## 🎯 MAJOR ARCHITECTURE SHIFT (2025-10-03)
**CloudSync is evolving from a sync tool to an intelligent orchestrator** that coordinates Git, Git-Annex, and rclone for optimal cloud storage workflows with unified versioning across all file types.

## What's Actually Done ✅
- [x] Project structure created with proper directory organization
- [x] Migrated existing sync scripts from `/scripts/cloud/`
- [x] Configuration management system established
- [x] Health monitoring system implemented
- [x] Documentation framework set up
- [x] GitHub repository created and made private
- [x] Enhanced .gitignore with comprehensive cloud sync patterns
- [x] Universal Project Documentation Standard structure implemented
- [x] **Smart Deduplication** - Hash-based duplicate detection and removal
- [x] **Checksum Verification System** - MD5/SHA1 integrity checking with reporting
- [x] **Bidirectional Sync** - Two-way synchronization with rclone bisync
- [x] **Conflict Detection & Resolution** - Automatic and interactive conflict handling
- [x] **Enhanced Health Monitoring** - Advanced feature status and usage tracking
- [x] **Comprehensive Documentation** - Architecture, setup, troubleshooting guides
- [x] **OneDrive Multi-Device Coordination** - Foundation complete (2025-10-03)
- [x] **Git-Annex Integration** - Full OneDrive integration with rclone transport (2025-10-03)

## In Progress 🟡 → ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION
- [x] Script migration and organization
- [x] Enhanced sync capabilities (bidirectional, conflict resolution)  
- [x] Git-annex + OneDrive foundation
- [ ] **Orchestrator Development** - Intelligent tool coordination (NEW PRIORITY)
- [ ] **Unified Versioning System** - Git-based versioning for all file types (NEW)
- [ ] **Decision Engine** - Smart routing between Git/Git-annex/rclone (NEW)

## Completed Foundation ✅
- **Core Sync Engine:** All 4 advanced features implemented and tested
- **Configuration System:** Centralized, flexible configuration management  
- **Monitoring System:** Comprehensive health checks and feature detection
- **Documentation:** Complete technical documentation with examples
- **Testing:** All scripts validated with dry-run operations
- **Git-Annex:** Production-ready large file management with OneDrive
- **Multi-Tool Integration:** Git + Git-annex + rclone working together

## NEW PRIORITY ACTIONS (Orchestrator Phase)
1. **Build Intelligent Orchestrator** - Single interface for Git/Git-annex/rclone
2. **Implement Unified Versioning** - Git-based versioning for all operations
3. **Create Decision Engine** - Smart tool selection based on context
4. **Design Managed Storage** - ~/cloudsync-managed/ with Git foundation
5. **Unified Interface** - cloudsync add/sync/rollback commands
