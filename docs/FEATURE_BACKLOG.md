## 📋 Planned Enhancements

### Tier 1: Quick Wins (Low Effort, High Value)

#### 1. Bundle Consolidation Monitoring
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-07)
**Effort:** Low
**Value:** Medium
**Priority:** High

**Description:**
Monitor incremental bundle chains and alert when consolidation is needed to prevent performance degradation and restore complexity.

**Problem it solves:**
- Incremental bundles accumulate over time (repo updates create new bundles)
- Long bundle chains slow down restore operations
- Eventually, bundle chains become unwieldy (e.g., 50+ incremental bundles)
- No current visibility into when consolidation should happen

**How it works:**
1. Track `incremental_count` in bundle manifests
2. Alert when count exceeds threshold (configurable, default: 10)
3. Provide consolidation command to merge incremental bundles into new full bundle
4. Optional: Auto-consolidate on weekly schedule

**Implementation tasks:**
- [ ] Add threshold checking to verify-restore.sh
- [ ] Create consolidation function in git-bundle-sync.sh
- [ ] Send notification when threshold exceeded
- [ ] Add `consolidate` command to bundle sync script
- [ ] Optional: Weekly auto-consolidation in cron

**Files to create/modify:**
- `scripts/bundle/git-bundle-sync.sh` - Add consolidation logic
- `scripts/bundle/verify-restore.sh` - Add threshold warnings
- `config/bundle-sync.conf` - Add consolidation threshold setting

**Configuration example:**
```bash
# Alert when incremental bundle count exceeds threshold
CONSOLIDATION_THRESHOLD=10

# Auto-consolidate on weekly schedule (true/false)
AUTO_CONSOLIDATE=false
```

**Use case:**
After 15 days of changes to a large repo, you get notification:
> ⚠️ CloudSync: Consolidation Needed
> Repository "Work/spaceful" has 12 incremental bundles (threshold: 10)
> Run: ./scripts/bundle/git-bundle-sync.sh consolidate Work/spaceful

#### 2. Storage Optimization
**Status:** Planned
**Effort:** Low
**Value:** Medium
**Priority:** High

**Description:**
Identify and clean up stale bundles, duplicate files, and provide storage usage reports to optimize OneDrive usage.

**Features:**
- Identify bundles older than X days with no changes
- Clean up orphaned bundle files (no manifest)
- Compress bundle archives for better storage efficiency
- Generate storage usage reports
- Optional: Archive old bundles to separate location

**Implementation tasks:**
- [ ] Create storage audit script
- [ ] Identify stale/orphaned bundles
- [ ] Add cleanup command with dry-run mode
- [ ] Generate storage usage reports (JSON/text)
- [ ] Add archival functionality for old bundles

**Files to create:**
- `scripts/bundle/storage-optimize.sh` - Main optimization script
- `scripts/bundle/storage-report.sh` - Generate usage reports

**Commands:**
```bash
# Audit storage
./scripts/bundle/storage-report.sh

# Dry-run cleanup
./scripts/bundle/storage-optimize.sh --dry-run

# Clean up stale bundles (older than 90 days)
./scripts/bundle/storage-optimize.sh --clean --age 90
```

**Use case:**
Identify that you have 500MB of duplicate bundles from failed sync attempts and clean them up automatically.

### Tier 2: High Value Features (Medium Effort)

#### 3. Real-time File Watching
**Status:** Planned

- Desktop notifications for auto-syncs
- Configurable watch directories and patterns

**Implementation tasks:**
- [ ] Install/check for inotify-tools dependency
- [ ] Create file watcher daemon script
- [ ] Add debouncing logic (wait N seconds after last change)
- [ ] Integrate with git-bundle-sync.sh (single repo mode)
- [ ] Add systemd service file for automatic startup
- [ ] Configuration for watch paths and exclusions

**Files to create:**
- `scripts/watchers/file-watcher.sh` - Main watcher daemon

)

# Debounce delay (seconds)
DEBOUNCE_DELAY=30

# Events to watch (modify, create, delete, move)
WATCH_EVENTS="modify,create,delete,move"
```

**Use case:**
You commit changes to a repo at 3 PM, file watcher detects it, waits 30 seconds for additional changes, then automatically creates bundle and syncs to OneDrive.

**Files to modify:**
- `scripts/bundle/git-bundle-sync.sh` - Multi-remote support
- `scripts/bundle/restore-from-bundle.sh` - Failover logic

**Configuration example:**
```bash
# Primary remote (fastest)
PRIMARY_REMOTE=onedrive:DevEnvironment/bundles

# Backup remotes (redundancy)
BACKUP_REMOTES=(
    "gdrive:CloudSync/bundles"
    "s3:my-backup-bucket/bundles"
)

# Enable multi-cloud sync
MULTI_CLOUD_ENABLED=true
```

**Use case:**
OneDrive has an outage, CloudSync automatically detects failure and restores from Google Drive backup without user intervention.
